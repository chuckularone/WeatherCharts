# Purpose

The purpose of this suite of scripts is to publish hyperlocal weather elements from my home weather station to my blog:
```
	http:/theshanty.us/index.php/weather-stuff/
```

It publishes charts for the temperature, pressure and humidity daily starting at midnight

```
It uses: 
	Unix Shell Scripting
    Curl
	The Weather Underground API
	JSON parsing to CSV
	Python
		pandas
		matplotlib
	And Wordpress
```

### To do: 
1. Archive daily charts for future retrieval
2. Develop a way to slect and scan past charts
3. Develop a way to combine data from a date range into a single chart.
